# GHS-S2Net
Is a repository of the all pre-trained models for built-up areas extraction from Sentinel-2 (4Bands 10 m resolution data).
The models were obtained by training the GHS-S2Net CNN architecture using detailed learning sets per UTM grid zone 
The method is described in Corbane et al. 2020 :
